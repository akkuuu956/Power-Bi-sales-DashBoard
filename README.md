# Power-Bi-sales-DashBoard
we analyze an eCommerce sales data set using Power BI to gain insights into sales revenue, delivery times, product profitability, customer segments, and more. We showcase the power of Power BI in visualizing complex data and providing actionable insights for business decisions


However, I can describe generally how I would approach analyzing the data to answer those types of questions if I did have access:

1. Total sales: To calculate total sales revenue for each year, I would likely aggregate the sales data by year and sum the sales amounts. To calculate growth, I could compare the totals year-over-year. 

2. Average delivery time: I would aggregate the delivery time data by year and take the mean. I could visualize this in a chart to see if times improved or worsened.

3. Total quantity sold: I would sum the quantity sold per product per year. I could then rank products to see if any sold particularly well. 

4. Total returns: I would sum return amounts per year and calculate as a percentage of sales per year to analyze trends.

5. Top products by profit: I would calculate profitability per product (likely sales - costs) and rank products by profit per year. I could visualize yearly changes.  

6. Top customers: Rank customers by total sales per year to analyzeconsistencies.

7. Segment sales: Sum sales by segment and year and analyze trends over time, flagging exceptionally performing or poorly performing segments. 

8. Sales by geography: Plot sales data on a map visualization to identify regional patterns. Look at metrics like average sales or number of customers in urban vs. rural areas.

9. Market-wise sales: Identify relevant markets, sum sales per market per year, and analyze for trends over time. Flag markets that stand out for better or worse performance.

In summary, I would leverage aggregation, summation, ranking, segmentation, and visualization to derive insights from the data for the key business questions posed.
